# Docker volumes
# These are managed by Docker Compose and should not be in Git
# The actual paths might vary, but typically it's named volumes
# and not raw folders in your project unless you changed paths.
# If you put chroma_data directly in your project root, add it here.
# Examples if they were in your project dir:
# postgres_data/
# ollama_models/
# chroma_data/
# You generally want to keep Docker Compose volumes outside the project.
